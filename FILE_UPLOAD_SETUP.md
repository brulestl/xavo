- **File Previews**: Compact and detailed file preview components
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and error recovery

### AI-Powered Analysis
- **Image Analysis**: Uses OpenAI Vision API to analyze and describe images
- **PDF Analysis**: Provides guidance and context for PDF documents
- **Text Analysis**: Extracts insights and key points from text files
- **Smart Context**: AI analysis is automatically included in chat conversations

### File Management
- **Secure Storage**: Files stored in Supabase Storage with proper authentication
- **Database Tracking**: Metadata and analysis results stored in database
- **File Validation**: Size limits (10MB) and type restrictions for security

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Core Components

1. **AttachmentMenu** (`src/components/AttachmentMenu.tsx`)
   - Floating menu with camera, photo, and file options
   - Smooth animations and responsive design
   - Proper accessibility and touch targets

2. **FilePreview** (`src/components/FilePreview.tsx`)
   - Compact and full preview modes
   - Shows upload progress and analysis status
   - Displays AI analysis results with expandable view

3. **Enhanced Composer** (`src/components/Composer.tsx`)
   - Integrated attachment system
   - File preview carousel
   - Updated send functionality with attachment support

4. **FileAnalysisService** (`src/services/fileAnalysisService.ts`)
   - Handles file upload to Supabase Storage
   - Integrates with OpenAI APIs for content analysis
   - Manages file validation and error handling

### Database Schema

The system uses a `user_files` table for storing file metadata:

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_files (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  session_id TEXT,
  file_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  file_path TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  file_url TEXT NOT NULL,
  file_size BIGINT DEFAULT 0,
  file_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  upload_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  analysis_data JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Required

### 1. OpenAI API Key

Add your OpenAI API key to `app.json`:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "extra": {
      "openaiApiKey": "sk-proj-your-openai-api-key-here"
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Supabase Storage Bucket

Create a `user-files` storage bucket in your Supabase project:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Storage
2. Create new bucket named `user-files`
3. Set appropriate RLS policies:

```sql
-- Allow authenticated users to upload files
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload files" ON storage.objects
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    bucket_id = 'user-files' AND 
    auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );

-- Allow users to read their own files
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own files" ON storage.objects
  FOR SELECT USING (
    bucket_id = 'user-files' AND 
    auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );
```

### 3. Database Setup

Run the SQL schema creation script:

```bash
psql -h your-supabase-host -U postgres -d postgres -f sql/create_user_files_table.sql
```

### 4. App Permissions

The app includes the necessary permissions in `app.json`:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      "expo-secure-store",
      "expo-web-browser", 
      "expo-document-picker",
      "expo-camera",
      "expo-image-picker"
    ],
    "ios": {
      "infoPlist": {
        "NSMicrophoneUsageDescription": "Xavo uses your microphone to record voice messages for AI coaching conversations.",
        "NSCameraUsageDescription": "Xavo uses your camera to capture photos for sharing context with your AI coach."
      }
    },
    "android": {
      "permissions": [
        "READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE",
        "WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE", 
        "RECORD_AUDIO",
        "CAMERA"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

   if (!validation.valid) {
     Alert.alert('Invalid File', validation.error);
     return;
   }
   ```

2. **Upload and Analysis**:
   ```typescript
   const analyzedFile = await fileAnalysisService.uploadAndAnalyze(
     file,
     userId,
     sessionId,
     onProgress,
