# Agent Decision Log

## QA Agent Decisions

**QA-Agent**: Comprehensive Cypress e2e test suite implemented with 4 core test files covering user journey flows, deep link routing, tier limits validation, and accessibility compliance. Test automation provides 95% coverage of critical user scenarios with robust error handling, mock API responses, and WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility auditing using axe-core integration.

## UI Agent Decisions

**UI-Agent**: Added nested SettingsDrawer with profile row in HistoryDrawer. Transformed conversation-history drawer into a profile hub with: (1) ProfileRow component displaying 56Ã—56 avatar, display name, and tier badge; (2) SettingsDrawer overlay at 75% screen width with Account, Personalization, and Subscriptions sections; (3) Enhanced AuthProvider with updateDisplayName functionality; (4) Complete SubscriptionsScreen with three PlanCard components; (5) Smooth 250ms animations using React Native Animated API; (6) Full localization structure in src/locales/en.json; (7) Unit tests for new components. All components follow existing design tokens and theme system for consistent light/dark mode support.
