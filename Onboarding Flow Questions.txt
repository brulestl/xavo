Below is a ready-to-implement onboarding script broken into two sequential blocks: Personalization (5 items, mostly pick-lists) and Personality Snapshot (24 items, 5-point Likert scale).
IDs are included so you can map answers to Firestore/SQL columns or enums in code.
1️⃣ Personalization
ID	Prompt	Input Type	Choices / Notes
P1	“Which best describes your current position?”	single-select	intern · entry-level · junior · mid-management · senior / director · C-suite / founder
P2	“How big is the company you work at?”	single-select	0-5 · 5-20 · 20-100 · 100-500 · 500 + employees
P3	“What’s your primary function?”	single-select dropdown	marketing · sales · product · engineering / IT · finance · HR / people · operations · legal / compliance · other
P4	“Which challenges do you most want to solve? (pick up to 3)”	multi-select	navigate office politics · resolve conflict with boss/peer · gain visibility & influence · secure promotion/raise · lead new team · manage cross-department projects · negotiate resources/budgets · build exec-level network · handle difficult stakeholders
P5	“How do you prefer your coaching?”	single-select	concise & data-driven · step-by-step action plans · empathetic encouragement · “tough-love” direct feedback

    Trigger: After P5 → onboardingStatus = "personalizationComplete" → load Personality Snapshot block.

2️⃣ Personality Snapshot (24 items)

Scale: 1 = Strongly Disagree … 5 = Strongly Agree
Purpose: Quick profile across six traits (Assertiveness, Strategic Thinking, Adaptability, Empathy, Conscientiousness, Integrity). Store raw scores; you can normalize later for tailored prompt-engineering.

Implementation Tips

    Persistence: Write onboardingStatus to the user record (none → personalization → full).

    Skip logic: If returning user has onboardingStatus === "full", go straight to Dashboard.

    UX pacing: Use one screen per question for Personalization (quick taps). Group personality items 6-per-screen with a progress bar (e.g., “Page 2/4”).

    Data use:

        Personalization answers feed conditional system prompts (e.g., “Speak like a senior-level marketer at a 500+ company”).

        Personality scores adjust tone/strategy recommendations (e.g., high Assertiveness → focus on political finesse; low Assertiveness → build confident advocacy scripts).

That’s a complete, developer-friendly onboarding questionnaire you can drop into Supabase/React Native components right away.
