# Profile Settings Drawer Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Overview

Successfully enhanced the conversation-history drawer to double as a "profile hub" with nested settings functionality. When users tap the hamburger menu, they now see a profile row at the top of the conversations drawer. Tapping this profile row slides in a comprehensive Settings Drawer covering 75% of the screen width.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria Completed

### ✓ Profile Row in History Drawer
- **56 × 56 avatar** with initials placeholder
- **Display name** + **tier badge** chip (Essential/Power/Guest)
- **Full-width touch target** with minimum 48px height
- **Divider below** the row → existing "Your past conversations..." list

### ✓ Settings Drawer (75% width)
**Account Section:**
- Editable Display Name (TextInput, save on blur)
- Email (read-only display)
- Tier badge (non-editable)

**Personalization Section:**
- "Edit profile answers" button → navigates to OnboardingEditScreen (stub implemented)

**Subscriptions Section:**
- List item that pushes SubscriptionsScreen

**Sign Out:**
- Red text button with confirmation alert
- Calls AuthContext.signOut()

### ✓ SubscriptionsScreen
- Header bar with back arrow
- Three PlanCard components stacked vertically (Free, Essential, Power)
- Each card shows: plan name, price/mo, bullet perks, CTA button
- Dynamic button states (Upgrade/Downgrade/Current) based on user tier
- "Most Popular" badge on Power Strategist plan

### ✓ Navigation & UX
- DrawerNavigator → HistoryDrawer (85% width) → SettingsDrawer (75% width)
- Close handle (chevron ←) top-right
- Swipe-to-close enabled
- 250ms fade-slide animation

### ✓ Theme & Motion
- Re-uses existing light/dark tokens
- Soft 12px corners, subtle shadow (elevation: 4)
- Consistent sheet/drawer easing (250ms duration)

### ✓ State & Data
- Extended AuthContext with `updateDisplayName(name: string)`
- Fetches tier from context for badge display
- Name editing persists to Supabase user metadata

- **Safe Areas**: Proper SafeAreaView usage throughout

## 🔄 State Management

- **Local State**: Component-level for UI interactions
- **Context State**: AuthProvider for persistent user data
- **Navigation State**: React Navigation for screen transitions
- **Async Storage**: Theme preferences and user settings

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Component rendering and interactions
- **Integration**: Drawer navigation flows
- **Accessibility**: Proper touch targets and screen reader support
- **Error Handling**: Network failures and edge cases

## 🎯 User Experience Flow

1. **User taps hamburger** → HistoryDrawer slides in (85% width)
2. **User sees ProfileRow** → Avatar, name, tier badge at top
3. **User taps ProfileRow** → SettingsDrawer slides over (75% width)
4. **User edits name** → Save on blur, persist to Supabase

## 📋 Remaining TODOs

1. Integrate actual Stripe payment processing
2. Implement OnboardingEditScreen functionality
3. Add avatar upload capabilities
4. Connect to real conversation history API
5. Enhance test coverage with better mocking
6. Add i18n support for multiple languages
