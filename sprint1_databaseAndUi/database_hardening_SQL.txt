SPRINT 1: DATABASE HARDENING & AUTOMATION SUMMARY
Corporate Influence Coach - Database Implementation Actions
===============================================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
This document summarizes all database hardening actions, SQL implementations, 
and automation features completed in Sprint 1 for the Corporate Influence Coach 
application.

===============================================================================
1. INITIAL SCHEMA MIGRATION
===============================================================================

COMPLETED ACTIONS:
✓ Created complete database schema with 8 core tables
✓ Implemented pgvector extension for semantic search
✓ Set up Row-Level Security (RLS) policies for data isolation
✓ Added comprehensive indexes for performance optimization
✓ Seeded 29 onboarding questions (5 personalization + 24 personality)

KEY TABLES IMPLEMENTED:
- onboarding_questions: Static questionnaire framework
- onboarding_answers: User responses with JSONB flexibility
- user_personalization: Enhanced user profiles with personality scores
- conversation_sessions: Chat session management
- conversation_messages: All messages with vector embeddings
- short_term_contexts: Session-level conversation summaries
- long_term_memories: Cross-session user knowledge and patterns
- user_profiles: Basic user preferences and work context

SCHEMA FEATURES:
- Vector embeddings (1536 dimensions) for semantic search
- Automatic personality score calculation via triggers
- Comprehensive foreign key relationships with CASCADE deletes
- JSONB fields for flexible data structures
- Timestamp tracking for all records

===============================================================================
2. AUTOMATED SUMMARIZATION SYSTEM
===============================================================================

IMPLEMENTED FUNCTION: fn_generate_session_summary()

PURPOSE:
Automatically generates conversation summaries after every 10 messages

FUNCTIONALITY:
- Pulls last 10 messages from a session
- Creates rule-based summary (placeholder for OpenAI integration)
- Extracts key topics using keyword filtering
- Inserts summary into short_term_contexts table
- Maintains version control (keeps last 5 summaries per session)
- Sends PostgreSQL notifications for external system integration

KEY FEATURES:
- Security: SECURITY DEFINER for elevated privileges
- Error handling: Graceful fallback if no messages found
- Topic extraction: Filters for relevant coaching keywords
- Versioning: Automatic version numbering and cleanup
- Notifications: pg_notify for real-time monitoring

SAMPLE USAGE:
```sql
SELECT fn_generate_session_summary(
  session_id, 
  user_id, 
  triggering_message_id
);
```

===============================================================================
3. AUTOMATED TRIGGER SYSTEM
===============================================================================

IMPLEMENTED TRIGGER: trigger_session_summary_auto

TRIGGER LOGIC:
- Fires AFTER INSERT on conversation_messages table
- Only processes assistant role messages (ensures complete exchanges)
- Checks for balanced conversation (both user and assistant messages)
- Triggers summarization every 10 messages
- Validates minimum message counts before execution

TRIGGER FUNCTION: trigger_auto_session_summary()

BUSINESS RULES:
- Requires at least 5 user messages and 5 assistant messages
- Only fires on assistant message insertion
- Counts total messages to determine when to summarize
- Calls fn_generate_session_summary() automatically

IMPLEMENTATION:
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_session_summary_auto
  AFTER INSERT ON conversation_messages
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION trigger_auto_session_summary();
```

===============================================================================
4. SCHEDULED AUTOMATION JOBS
===============================================================================

NIGHTLY MEMORY PROMOTION JOB:

SCHEDULE: Daily at 03:00 UTC
FUNCTION: fn_promote_short_to_long() (from previous migration)
PURPOSE: Promotes aged short-term contexts to long-term memories

IMPLEMENTATION:
```sql
SELECT cron.schedule(
  'memory-promotion-nightly',
  '0 3 * * *',
  'SELECT fn_promote_short_to_long();'
);
```

REQUIREMENTS:
- Requires superuser privileges for pg_cron
- Processes contexts older than 30 days
- Filters by context_weight >= 0.7
- Prevents duplicate promotions

ERROR HANDLING:
- Graceful fallback when cron privileges unavailable
- Logs scheduling status via RAISE NOTICE
- Continues operation if scheduling fails

===============================================================================
5. COMPREHENSIVE UNIT TESTING
===============================================================================

AUTOMATED TEST SUITE:

TEST 1: Summarization Trigger Validation
- Creates test user and session
- Inserts 11 alternating user/assistant messages
- Verifies exactly 1 summary generated at message 10
- Validates message count and summary existence
- Automatic cleanup on success or failure

TEST ASSERTIONS:
```sql
ASSERT summary_count = 1, 'Expected 1 summary, found ' || summary_count;
ASSERT message_count = 11, 'Expected 11 messages, found ' || message_count;
```

TEST RESULTS:
✓ Summarization trigger fires correctly at 10th message
✓ Only processes assistant messages as designed
✓ Generates exactly one summary per trigger event
✓ Maintains data integrity throughout process

ERROR HANDLING:
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks
- Automatic test data cleanup
- Detailed error reporting with SQLERRM
- Rollback protection for failed tests

===============================================================================
6. PERFORMANCE & OPTIMIZATION
===============================================================================

INDEXING STRATEGY:
- HNSW indexes on all vector columns for fast similarity search
- Composite indexes on frequently queried column combinations
- GIN indexes on array columns (topics, challenges)
- B-tree indexes on timestamps and foreign keys

QUERY OPTIMIZATION:
- Efficient message retrieval with ROW_NUMBER() window functions
- Optimized topic extraction using regexp functions
- Batch processing for large data operations
- Connection pooling considerations in function design

MEMORY MANAGEMENT:
- Automatic cleanup of old summaries (keeps last 5 versions)
- Cascade delete relationships for data consistency
- Efficient storage using JSONB for flexible fields
- Vector dimension optimization (1536 for OpenAI compatibility)

===============================================================================
7. SECURITY & PERMISSIONS
===============================================================================

ROW-LEVEL SECURITY (RLS):
- All tables protected with user-specific access policies
- SECURITY DEFINER functions for elevated operations
- Authenticated role permissions for user-facing functions
- Postgres role restrictions for system functions

PERMISSION GRANTS:
```sql
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION fn_generate_session_summary TO authenticated;
```

DATA ISOLATION:
- Users can only access their own data
- Session-based access controls
- Automatic user_id validation in all operations
- Foreign key constraints enforce data relationships

AUDIT TRAIL:
- PostgreSQL notifications for all summary generations
- Timestamp tracking on all records
- Version control for summary iterations
- Comprehensive logging via RAISE NOTICE

===============================================================================
8. NOTIFICATION & MONITORING SYSTEM
===============================================================================

POSTGRESQL NOTIFICATIONS:

EVENT: summary_generated
PAYLOAD: JSON with session_id, user_id, summary_id, version, message_count
PURPOSE: Real-time notification of summary creation for external systems

IMPLEMENTATION:
```sql
PERFORM pg_notify(
  'summary_generated',
  json_build_object(
    'session_id', p_session_id,
    'user_id', p_user_id,
    'summary_id', v_new_summary_id,
    'version', v_next_version,
    'message_count', v_message_count
  )::text
);
```

INTEGRATION POINTS:
- Node.js workers can listen via LISTEN/NOTIFY
- Real-time dashboard updates
- Analytics event tracking
- External system integrations

===============================================================================
9. FUTURE OPENAI INTEGRATION PREPARATION
