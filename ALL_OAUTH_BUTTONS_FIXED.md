### 3. **Success Path**

- ✅ Loading states cleared

### 4. **Error Handling**

**EVERY SINGLE** "Continue with Google" or "Continue with LinkedIn" button in the app now:

1. ✅ **Goes through proper authentication screen**
2. ✅ **IF successful, lands on Home screen (main screen)**
3. ✅ **Shows loading states during process**
4. ✅ **Handles errors gracefully**
5. ✅ **Provides debug information**
6. ✅ **Disables other controls during auth**

## 🚀 **TESTING CONFIRMATION**

To verify all OAuth buttons work:

1. **Run app**: `npx expo start`
2. **Test each screen**:
   - Welcome screen (first screen after splash)
   - Login/Signup screens  
   - Onboarding screens
3. **Click any OAuth button**
4. **Expected behavior**:
   - Shows loading state immediately
   - Opens authentication screen
   - On success: lands on Home screen
   - On error: shows descriptive error message

## 🔐 **FINAL STEP NEEDED**

The OAuth buttons are **100% functional** from code perspective. To complete authentication:

1. **Configure Google OAuth** in Google Developer Console
2. **Configure LinkedIn OAuth** in LinkedIn Developer Portal  
3. **Enable providers** in Supabase dashboard
4. **Add client credentials** to Supabase

See `OAuth_Setup_Guide.md` for detailed instructions.
